What is API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. 
APIs define the methods and data formats that developers can use to request and exchange information between software components.
API collects and processes a response, then returns with that response.

Example Google Maps and Uber: 
Google Maps is using Uber API to request information by sending HTTP request function with the start and end point of the ride.
Ubers API then sends information back such as how many cars are available and the cost of the various ride options.
This information is then processed by Google Maps and is available to the user directly linking them the Uber app.
