Bermoulli Distribution
A stock is prices at $100 and follows a one-period binomial process with an up move that equals 1.05 and a down move that equals 0.97. If one million Bernoulli trials are performed and the average terminal stock price is $102
, the probability of an up move is closest to ____?

Current stock price (S0) = $100.00
Up move (Su) = 1.05
Down move (Sd) = 0.97
Average terminal stock price (Savg) = $102.00

Given these probabilities you can compute the expected value:
x=p⋅105+(1−p)⋅97.

Now we know that x=102, so
102=105p-97-97p
 p =5/8.
